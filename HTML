       <ul>
         <li>1962・Born Noriko Kamachi of the Kamachi clan in Fukuoka Japan on March 10th, 1962.</li>
         <li>1978・Adopted the stage name "Matsuda Seiko" after winning the "Miss Seventeen" magazine pageant.</li>
         <li>1980・Formally debuted with the single "Hadashi no Kisetsu." Her 3rd single, "Kaze wa Aki-iro," became the 1st of what would be 24 consecutive number 1 hits on the Oricon Japanese music charts.</li>
         <li>1983・Won her 1st best performance award by the Nippon Record Awards for her single "ガラスの林檎 (lit. Glass Apple)."</li>
         <li>1985・Got married to actor Kanda Masaki in a highly televised wedding that cost approximately $2 million.</li>
         <li>1986・Gave birth to her only child, a daughter named "SAYAKA." At the time, it was uncommon for female entertainers to continue their careers after marriage and kids. But promptly after, Seiko promptly went back to work, gaining her the nickname "Mamaidol."</li>
         <li>1990・Made her American debut with the self-titled album 'Seiko,' with the song "The Right Combination" featuring Donnie Wahlberg of New Kids on the Block.</li>
         <li>1993・Won her 2nd best performance award by the Nippon Record Awards for her single " 'きっと、また逢える・・・' (lit. Surely, will meet again).'"</li>
         <li>1997・Divorced her husband Kanda Masaki and went on to marry her second husband "Hatano Hiroyuki," a dentist to whom she was married from 1998 to 2000. She would go on to have a 3rd marriage to university professor "Kawana Hiromasa" in June 2012.</li>
         <li>2007・Released her first completely self-produced album, "Baby's Breath."</li>
         <li>2011・Was named the No. 1 everlasting idol of all time by Oricon, beating out rivals including  Momoe Yamaguchi (2), Kyōko Koizumi (3), Morning Musume (4) and Akina Nakamori (5)</li>
         <li>2015・Won the Japan Record Awards' Best Performance Award, the Japanese equivalent of a Grammy and Japan's most prestigious award in the Japanese music industry.</li>
         <li>Today・Matsuda Seiko still holds annual concerts, many of those being Christmas and New Year's Eve dinner shows, as well as dome concerts. Despite the expensive ticket prices, these shows sell out quickly and are a testament to her title of Japan's "Everlasting Idol."
